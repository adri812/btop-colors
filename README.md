To change the colors you can manually, do it by going to themes -> custom.theme
You can copy and paste it in "editor" ~/.config/btop/themes/custom.theme
The file will be empty so just copy it in

Now for it to work you will need to open ~/.config/btop/btop.conf
Line 5 : youll change it from "deafult" to "custom"

Finally open btop :D
