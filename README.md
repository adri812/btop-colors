To change the do it by going to themes -> custom.theme

Copy everything and paste to "~/.config/btop/themes/custom.theme"

The file will be empty so just copy it in

Now for it to work you will need to open "~/.config/btop/btop.conf"
  
Line 5 : youll change it from "deafult" to "custom"

Finally open btop :D
